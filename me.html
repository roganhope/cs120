  <p>Hello there! I'm excited to be part of this class because I genuinely enjoy the creative aspects of web development. The combination of technical skills and artistic design is what drew me in. In today's world, web development is omnipresent, and I believe that to be a well-rounded Computer Science student, understanding how the web works is crucial.

    While I have some experience with front-end development, the back-end side is uncharted territory for me. I've completed some free online courses and dabbled in setting up cards on a business page, but there's so much more to explore and learn!

    Here are a few things about me:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>I have a deep love for anything Armenian Cuisine.</li>
    <li>Salmon Sashimi is a personal favorite.</li>
    <li>Mushroom Ravioli always hits the spot.</li>
  </ul>
