        <p> One of my favorite trips I took was a special airbnb I reserved as a birthday trip for my boyfriend. It was a tiny home located in Chester, Vermont. We had a gorgeous tiny home, fire-pit, and star lit sky to ourselves. Our weekend was full of hiking, eating, and relaxing. It doesnâ€™t get better than that!</p>

        <p>Here is a link to my favorite resturaunt, <a target="_blank" href="https://noorgrill.com/">Noor Grill</a>.
        It is my family's establishment, and being completely unbiased, the food is delightful. I grew up eating nothing but rice pilaf, kebab, and salad. It's a taste of home and super fresh!</p>
